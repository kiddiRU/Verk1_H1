# Evening meeting (Diary)
## State of project:
- We are constantly having problems caused by corrupted data. The corruption was caused by inputting bad data for debugging purposes.
- Create Club now shows all color options which are allowed.
- Fixed Bug - Match Winner crash
- Fix Bug where 8 servers in a tournament and 2 teams caused a crash. We only allow 1 to 8 servers per tournament.
## State of group: 
I (Sindri) asked what the name of the group should be besides "Hópur 1" for the video. The first idea and winner by majority (5:1) was "Sindri Fan Club".
The group is quite tired of the project and want this to be over. Only 1 day left.
