# Evening meeting (Diary)
## State of project:
The group is working well on the project, we got the LogicLayer, DataLayer and Data to function with player

- Created use cases in latex desing doc 
## State of group: 
Elmar had a problem with GitHub, OneDrive corrupted an interactive rebase which caused git status to display that it was currently rebasing. Git could not find the rebase folder, so it could not rebase. The problem was solved when Kristinn fixed the issue deleting the rebase folder on Elmars laptop which forces Git to stop rebasing. 
Problem: Corrupt interactive rebase
Symptom: Git status would display that you were currently rebasing (run git rebase –continue) and this would return that some folder in .git/rebase-merge/ didn’t exist.
Solution: Delete directory .git/rebase-merge/ to trick git into not rebasing anymore.
