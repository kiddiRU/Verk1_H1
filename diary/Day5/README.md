# Morning meeting (Briefing)
## State of project: 
Design phase is almost complete, the only critical tasks left are the class diagram and formatting the design sketch into a polished design document. 
## State of group: 
Kristinn and Andri where not available, so they could not work today. The team on site expect to work until the desing document is delivered.
## Divisions: 
- UI / UX: Elmar
- System engineer: Ísak, Kristján 
- QC: Sindri

## ToDo-list:
- Class diagram
- Turning sketch to design doc
- Happy path
- Finish JSON data format
# Evening meeting (Diary)
## State of project:
- Is it allowed to use try & except with dict? Sindri asked the TA if it was allowed to use try & except with dict. They allowed try & except but not if it was being abused, when there was a better alternative. Dict has a get function that should be used.
- Finished Ui-tree
- Finished JSON data format
- Finished Happy path
- Created Class diagram
- Finished draft of design doc

## State of group: 
- Were in disagreement over how the system should keep track of user path. Sindri proposed that a singular class should keep track of user path, but Elmar brought up the option of having individual classes handaling user path.  
- Ísak proposed the idea that the TUI should have "handle" as "username", becasue we dont know if the user knows what a "handle" is. 
- We forgot about servers being a thing, servers host matches. 
- TA will allow us to have the system to manage scheduling, but the organnizer should have option to edit schedule. Decided that it was a c-req
## Divisions:
- UI / UX: Elmar
- System engineer: Ísak, Kristján 
- QC: Sindri
## ToDo-list:
- Start development phase
- Resolve path tracking
