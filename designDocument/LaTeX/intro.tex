\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to create an esports tournament managing system, the system supports
three user groups, organizer, player and spectators. The organizer can create and manage tournaments
and create clubs, players can be registered and after registering log in and manage and create teams,
and spectators can view information about players, teams, clubs and tournament.

The system is built using a three-tier-design with UI layer, logic layer and data layer. It also includes
a logic layer API and a data layer API. The UI only communicates with logic layer API, that communicates
with the logic layer which then communicate the data layer API that communicates with the data layer,
so the UI should never directly communicate with either the data layer or data layer API.
