\section{conclusion}
If the project were to be restarted, for better results certain parts would benefit from more
detailed planning, especially defining exactly what each layer should contain and how it should
function with a focus on the logic and UI layers. At the start of the project we didn't really know
how to structure and implement a three-tier-diagram so we didn't really know how to plan for it. 

Not all listed requirements were Completed because some were determined to be unnecessary or
not important to implement at this stage with the given time, making it more valuable to focus on improving
existing functionality.

Limited user tests where conducted. The product was tested by 5 individuals using laptop with the application 
running in a console shell.  Each user was given instructions based on our user stories. The user where 
easily able to complete their tasks with very little or not guidance needed beyond the prompts provided 
by the interface. No issues or defects where encountered during the user testing.  The general feedback was
that the product more or less worked as intended and was easy to navigate and operate.

If additional time were available or the project were to continue after these three weeks,
the next step would begin with implementing all missing requirements. After that, new requirements
could be identified and added, and finally and finally the UI and overall user experience would
be refined and polished.
