Write about summry

Write about why some requirements were not implemented

Write about what we learned

Write about what we did

Write about that we did user tests

Write about what would be our next step if given the chance

If the project were to be restarted, for better results certain parts would benefit from more
detailed planning, especially defining exactly what each layer should contain and how it should
function with a focus on the logic and UI layers. At the start of the project we didn't really know
how to structure and implement a three-tier-diagram so we didn't really know how to plan for it. 

Not all listed requirements were completed because some were determined to be unnecessary or
not important to implement at this stage with the given time, making it more valuable to focus on
improving existing functionality. 

If additional time were available or the project were to continue after these three weeks,
the next step would begin with implementing all missing requirements. After that, new requirements
could be identified and added, and finally the UI and overall user experience would
be refined and polished.
