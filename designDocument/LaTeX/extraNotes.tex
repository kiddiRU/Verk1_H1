\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Archives}

\subsubsection*{Tournament}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When the tournament is over then it is archived
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Team}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The place that a team goes to when a team captain is alone in a team and leaves the team (AKA: IF a team becomes empty)
    \item Stores empty teams and their scores (Should be able to view it)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Publish Tournament}
When managing the tournaments the Organizer has the option of publishing a tournament and by
pressing that option, he will get a list of available tournaments (AKA: Tournaments that have 16 or
more teams and tournaments that aren't already published). Then he will input what tournament he
wants to publish and that tournament

\subsection{Search Bar}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can input the name of a player directly
    \item IF unsure about the player options, then should be able to list every name
    \item The ability to search for the first letters to narrow down the list
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Example: Searching for available players for teams}

Add a Teams
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Enter Team name or l for the list of all team or q to quit: abcd
          \begin{itemize}
              \item  abcd was found are you sure you want to continue
          \end{itemize}
    \item Y Yes
    \item N No
\end{itemize}
Remove a Team
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Enter Team name or l for the list of all teams in the tournament or q to quit:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item  abcd is not a part of the tournament, do you want to continue
          \end{itemize}
    \item Y Yes
    \item N No
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Logic to use for multiple instances}
\subsection{States (For diagrams)}
A team needs to have at least 3 players to join a tournament \\
A team can have a maximum of 5 players? If it has 5 players, the captain cannot add more. \\
A player can have 3 states (Captain, In Team, Not In Team) \\
• Captain: Can view team and add or remove players \\
• Player in team: Can view his team, and can leave his team \\
• Player NOT in team: Can create a team \\
If captain leaves his team there can be two outcomes \\
• Captain leaves and selects a new captain from the team \\
• If the team is empty the captain leaves but the team still exists and has all statistics \\
A player can NOT leave his team if the team is in a tournament \\
\subsection{Player/Team Notes}
Color: simple length check \\
- Venue: simple length check \\
- Email: needs to go through a check \\
- Phone number: 7 Numbers \\
- Address: (strings)(space)(number) \\
- When taking input we will have a validator in the logic layer that returns whether it is valid
or not \\
- Valid player handle: Just about the length (3-12) NEED TO HAVE **ADMIN** in the
handle file \\
- Date stored YYYY-MM-DD \\
o Validation \\
All need to be numbers that are not the ``-'' \\
Year: \\
Month: 01 <= month <= 12 \\
- If the C color requirement will be used then there should only be options for the user (Can \\
only choose color out of few chosen colors) \\
- Randomize team list for tournaments \\
- At least 16 teams in a tournament \\
- Teams cannot Play in multiple matches at the same time \\
- The main interactions from the user is with shown steps like: 1) Login, 2) Sign Up, b) back \\
... something like that (can also have some commands) \\
- Everyone should be able to see all active Teams (in an active tournament) \\
