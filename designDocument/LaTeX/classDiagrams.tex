\section{ Class Diagrams}

\small Class diagrams are the main building block in object-oriented modeling. They are used to show the
different objects in a system, their attributes, their operations and the relationship between them.
The two class diagrams are with model classes and 3 tier design classes. Model classes are a class
(bucket) that is just the data, with few functions. While the 3-tier design splits the classes into the
user interaction layer, logic layer and data layer, which are connected by so called wrappers that
make it so that each layer doesn't impact the rest of the layers to make it easier refactor or change
classes or functions without the other layers getting affected. The diagrams below show model
classes, 3-tier design and model classes combined with 3-tier design.
