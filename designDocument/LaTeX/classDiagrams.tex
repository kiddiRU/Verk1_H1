\section{ Class Diagrams}
\small Class diagrams are the main building block in object-oriented modeling. They are used to show the 
different objects in a system, their attributes, their operations and the relationship between them. 
The two class diagrams are model classes and 3 tier design classes. Model classes are a class (bucket) 
that is just the data, with few functions. While the 3-tier design splits the classes into the user 
interaction layer, logic layer and data layer, which are connected by so called wrappers that make it 
so that each layer doesn't impact the rest of the layers to make it easier refactor or change classes or 
functions without the other layers getting affected. The diagrams below show both the model classes and 
the three-tier design classes. For better visibility and readability, the model classes are split up and 
the three-tier classes are separated into their layers and then into individual classes.
