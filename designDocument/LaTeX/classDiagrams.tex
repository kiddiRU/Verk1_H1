\section{ Class Diagrams}
\small Class diagrams are the main building block in object-oriented modeling. They are used to show the 
different objects in a system, their attributes, their operations and the relationship between them. 
The two class diagrams are model classes and 3 tier design classes. Model classes are a class (bucket) 
that is just the data, with few functions. While the 3-tier design splits the classes into the user 
interaction layer, logic layer and data layer, which are connected by so called wrappers that make it 
so that each layer doesn't impact the rest of the layers to make it easier refactor or change classes or 
functions without the other layers getting affected. The diagrams below show both the model classes and 
the three-tier design classes. For better visibility and readability, the model classes are split up and 
the three-tier classes are separated into their layers and then into individual classes.

\subsection*{3-Tier Design}
\small The three-tier design below is split into several parts for better readability. 
The first image shows the complete design, although connections between classes within 
each layer are not included. The images following that are divided by layer, 
except for the IO layer, since it has no internal connections. 
Individual classes are also shown to further improve readability.
